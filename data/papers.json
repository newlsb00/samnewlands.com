    "abstract": "Monism, idealism, and panentheism each sit well outside the mainstream in contemporary philosophy. And yet, when appropriately combined, some of the most challenging questions facing each view independently can be answered by the others. I develop a Leibnizian form of panentheistic idealism on which everything besides God is a well-founded, merely representational object of a divine idea. This representational framework addresses persistent worries for panentheism about specifying its core containment relation and preventing the world's features from bleeding into God's nature. It also sidesteps structural worries facing constitutive forms of idealism and panpsychism, and it broadens Schaffer's mereological account of priority monism without trivially classifying traditional theists as monists. I close by examining a pair of internal challenges: worries about the distinction between actuality and mere possibility and about the status of finite subjects of experience."

Much of it is quite striking: Malebranche embraces tradition where one expects innovation, and he surprisingly breaks with centuries of Christian reflection at other key junctions. Malebranche's accounts of evil also weave together several of his central commitments in metaphysics, theology, and ethics, and so exploring Malebranche on evil opens a window into the heart of his philosophical and theological outlook. After presenting a basic framework for understanding Malebranche's views on evil, I examine both his traditionalism and his innovations."

While many of his early modern contemporaries raised narrower objections to particular claims in Spinoza's Ethics, Regis develops a broader anti-Spinozistic position, one that threatens the very core of Spinoza's metaphysical ambitions and offers a philosophically robust alternative. However, as with any far-reaching philosophical commitment, Regis's gambit comes with substantive costs of its own, including creating instabilities within the core of his own philosophical system. Far from diminishing the significance of Regis's anti-Spinozism, this critical appraisal helps us better appreciate both the conceptual pull of Spinozism within early modern metaphysics and one sweeping, albeit costly way of escaping its orbit."

Baumgarten himself would not be happy with these results, and I concede that some of his efforts to thwart Spinozism look promising. But there is one route to Spinozism that he fails to block, and at a key juncture, he inadvertently aids the Spinozist's cause. I conclude with an epilogue on how Baumgarten's path also foreshadows the next Spinozism flare-up heading into the German pantheism controversy."

In particular, I will claim that the same style of argument that might be offered for a Leibnizian form of metaphysical idealism actually leads beyond idealism to something closer to Spinozistic monism. Our road begins with a set of theological commitments about the nature and perfection of God that were widely shared among leading early modern philosophers. From these commitments, there arises an interesting case for metaphysical idealism, roughly the thesis that only minds and mind-dependent states actually exist. However, I will argue, that same theistic reasoning also leads to an idealist form of substance monism, the view that God is the only actual substance and that almost everything else is merely an intentional object in God's mind."

Although these are somewhat distinct concerns, they have a common, unified solution in Spinoza's system that is philosophically rich and interesting, both in its own right and in relation to contemporary work in moral philosophy. After presenting the core of the problem facing Spinoza's action theory, I turn to his overlooked account of selves, one that can be illuminated by contemporary work on so-called deep-self theories. I then show how Spinoza's distinctive account of selves prevents his action theory from collapsing into metaphysical incoherence, and conclude with an implication for Spinoza's broader account of transformation."

For example, he claims that perfection and imperfection, like good and evil, are \"mere modes of thinking.\" And yet, throughout his writings, Spinoza himself appeals to the perfection of things and God in realist-sounding ways. But in light of his critique of perfection realism, how can this be? In the first part of this chapter, I argue that Spinoza's critique of perfection realism is narrower than it initially seems, allowing him to treat what I will call a \"purely metaphysical\" notion of perfection as a mind-independent property of things and the world. In the second section, I outline one important element of Spinoza's purely metaphysical notion of perfection, one that sheds light on some of his otherwise puzzling ontological commitments. In the third section, I buttress this interpretation by pointing to two advocates of similar structural accounts of perfection who hail from very different eras: the young Leibniz and Jonathan Schaffer."

    "abstract": "This essay focuses on the concept of evil in the works of early modern rationalists, most especially Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, and Leibniz. As I read the period, early modern theodicies are most novel not in their positive explanations about the relation of evil to God, nearly all of which echo pre-modern theories. Rather, many of their greatest contributions lie in what they do not say, what they leave off from the tradition they inherited. In this paper, I focus on one such early modern eclipse, one that occurred with breath-taking swiftness and has proven prescient for many subsequent discussions of the concept of evil. Prior to the 17th century, there was near unanimous agreement among prominent medieval Christians that evil was a privation of goodness. But by the 18th century, privation theory had been mostly abandoned by leading theists. I explore the early modern case for challenging this once dominant concept of evil. In the concluding coda, I present one reason for doubting that the early modern legacy on this topic has been a wholly salutary one."

While many of his conclusions about the status and origins of universals were increasingly common in the 17th century, Spinoza insists that the consequences of falsely reifying universals reach farther than his contemporaries recognized. Spinoza also tries to integrate his criticisms of reified universals into distinctive tenets of his own metaphysics, epistemology, psychology, and even ethics. At the same time, however, Spinoza employs universal-like categories in very reifying-sounding ways, raising concerns about whether Spinoza fully abides by his own admonitions. In this paper, I look first at Spinoza's account of universals, focusing on what he takes to be their ontological status (section 1) and psychological origins (section 2). I then turn to Spinoza's critique of universals and highlight what he takes to be the dangerous and widespread consequences of falsely reifying abstractions (section 3). In the fourth and final section, I raise a worry about internal consistency and suggest ways to mitigate some \u2013 but only some \u2013 of the concern."

I further argue that the main early modern escape route, captured in notions like \"eminent containment,\" fails to adequately relieve the metaphysical pressures towards Spinozism. The upshot is that those sympathetic with these early modern projects must embrace a costlier option if they are to successfully escape the orbit of Spinoza."

As he warns readers in his earliest work, \"so long as we are dealing with the investigation of things, we must never infer anything from abstractions, and we shall take very great care not to mix up the things that are only in the intellect with those that are real\" (TIE 93). Although his attack on realist theories of universals in the Ethics is probably the most familiar upshot of this stance, Spinoza applies his anti-abstractionism broadly in these early writings to topics in ontology, theology, psychology, morality, mathematics, and philosophical methodology, and he blames a host of philosophical vices on the failure to respect the difference between abstract and real things. In this paper, I first explore Spinoza's early writings against abstracta (section 1) and abstract thinking (section 2). After clarifying his negative and positive views, I investigate whether Spinoza's early repudiation of abstractions and abstract thinking is consistent with his own ontology. I also look at Spinoza's only explicit argument in these texts for his anti-abstractionism. In the final part (section 3), I discuss the wide-ranging uses to which Spinoza puts his anti-abstractionism. I conclude by pointing to an especially broad, ethical/political use to which Spinoza later put his early anti-abstractionism, namely as a way of undermining the motivation for malicious disagreement and intolerance."

In this paper, I argue that this apparent about-face is misleading: the privation theory Leibniz later defends is not the traditional theory he once scorned. I show instead that Leibniz came to regard his own distinctive metaphysics of evil, his \"original limitation theory,\" as a suitable replacement for Scholastic privation theory and for which he could readily claim the mantle of traditionalism. I then explore Leibniz's original limitation theory in fresh detail and conclude that the Scholastics themselves would have rejected Leibniz's terminological co-opting on grounds that Leibniz's original limitation theory contains a false ontology of evil."

Although most of the discussion has focused on Leibniz's analyses of modality, this essay explores Leibniz's grounding of modality. Leibniz holds that possibilities and possibilia are grounded in the intellect of God. Although other early moderns agreed that modal truths are in some way dependent on God, there were sharp disagreements surrounding two distinct questions: (1) On what in God do modal truths and modal truth-makers depend? (2) What is the manner(s) of dependence by which modal truths and modal truth-makers depend on God? Very roughly, Leibniz's own answers are: (1) God's intellect and (2) a form of ontological dependence. The essay first distinguishes Leibniz's account from two nearby (and often misunderstood) alternatives found in Descartes and Spinoza. It then examines Leibniz's theory in detail, showing how, on his account, God's ideas provide both truth-makers for possibilities and necessities and an ontological foothold for those truth-makers, thereby explaining modal truths. Along the way, it suggests several refinements and possible amendments to Leibniz's grounding thesis. It then defends Leibniz against a pair of recent objections by Robert Merrihew Adams and Andrew Chignell that invoke the early work of Kant. I conclude that whereas Leibniz's alternative avoids collapsing into yet another form of Spinozism, the alternatives proposed by Adams, Chignell, and the early Kant do not."

This surprising conclusion, that the conceptual outstrips the mental, also sheds new light on the relationship between the attributes, the extent of parallelism, and the nature of extension. It also shows how Spinoza's frequent privileging of the conceptual avoids collapsing into idealism."

CDM also illuminates several of Spinoza's most striking metaphysical views, including the intensionality of causal contexts, parallelism, metaphysical perfection, and explanatory rationalism. I also argue that this priority of the conceptual does not commit Spinoza to forms of idealism or mentalism. For Spinoza, conceptual relations are kinds of objectively structured, concretely realized, metaphysical relations. But there are special features of conceptual relations, such as their fine-grained character and epistemic accessibility, that Spinoza thinks makes them especially well-suited to occupy this ontological pride of place in his system. The question of how to understand different kinds of metaphysical dependence is quite controversial in Spinoza studies; I address major alternative readings in the notes. I also try to draw connections to the growing debate in contemporary discussions about metaphysical dependence, as this topic is a happy point of shared interest between Spinoza and contemporary metaphysicians alike."

In this paper, I challenge both of these readings. Spinoza is no necessitarian and Leibniz is no anti-necessitarian \u2013 at least as these characterizations are usually understood. Rather, I contend, Spinoza and Leibniz are both anti-essentialists; they believe that the modal status of objects can vary relative to how those objects are conceived. This shared commitment to anti-essentialism allows them to consistently affirm both necessitarianism and its denial, relative to different ways of conceiving the world. Their embrace of this modal theory, I further argue, is grounded in their similar views on metaphysical perfection, ontological plentitude, and the principle of sufficient reason."
