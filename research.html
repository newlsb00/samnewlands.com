          My published work centers on three overlapping areas: early modern
          philosophy, metaphysics, and philosophy of religion. I served for more than a decade as a director of
          the Center for Philosophy of Religion at Notre Dame, and I have been
          a principal investigator for more than $12M in funded research projects. Below you will find a
          summary of my research interests and links to some of those projects. I also teach regularly on the ethics of digital technologies, philosophy of mind, and many other periods of philosophical history.

                The bulk of my published work focuses on the rich metaphysics of Spinoza and Leibniz,
                with an eye towards parallel work in contemporary metaphysics and many other early moderns.
                I have written about ontology, modality, dependence, causation, explanation, universals,
                idealism, monism, perfection, and representation.
                My work on Spinoza's metaphysics and ethics came together in
                <em>Reconceiving Spinoza</em> (Oxford University Press, 2018), which was generously funded by an NEH fellowship.
                I am currently working on a new, wide-ranging book project,
                <em>No Cheating! A Spinozistic Reading of Early Modern Metaphysics</em>, which has also been
                generously funded by the NEH.

                My research also focuses on early modern philosophy of religion, most
                especially the problem of evil and the nature of God. Early modern discussions of evil brought together
                complex metaphysical, theological, epistemological, and moral issues, and I enjoy
                trying to sort through them, always with an eye towards parallel discussions in
                contemporary philosophy of religion. I am currently working on a book on the metaphysics of evil, tentatively titled
                <em>Evil among the Early Moderns</em>
